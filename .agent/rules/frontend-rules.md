### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### NGRX

- Use the createFeature and createReducer functions to simplify reducer creation
- Implement the facade pattern to abstract NgRx implementation details from components
- Use entity adapter for collections to standardize CRUD operations
- Leverage selectors with memoization to efficiently derive state and prevent unnecessary calculations
- Implement @ngrx/effects for handling side effects like API calls
- Use action creators with typed payloads to ensure type safety throughout the application
- Implement @ngrx/component-store for local state management in complex components
- Use @ngrx/router-store to connect the router to the store
- Leverage @ngrx/entity-data for simplified entity management
- Implement the concatLatestFrom operator for effects that need state with actions

#### ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes instead of NgModules
- Implement signals for state management instead of traditional RxJS-based approaches
- Use the new inject function instead of constructor injection
- Implement control flow with @if, @for, and @switch instead of *ngIf, *ngFor, etc.
- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Use the new deferrable views for improved loading states
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Implement proper lazy loading with loadComponent and loadChildren

#### ANGULAR_MATERIAL

- Create a dedicated module for Angular Material imports to keep the app module clean
- Use theme mixins to customize component styles instead of overriding CSS
- Implement OnPush change detection for performance critical components
- Leverage the CDK (Component Development Kit) for custom component behaviors
- Use Material's form field components with reactive forms for consistent validation UX
- Implement accessibility attributes and ARIA labels for interactive components
- Use the new Material 3 design system updates where available
- Leverage the Angular Material theming system for consistent branding
- Implement proper typography hierarchy using the Material typography system
- Use Angular Material's built-in a11y features like focus indicators and keyboard navigation
